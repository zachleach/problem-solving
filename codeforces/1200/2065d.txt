given n arrays size m 
concatenate all arrays into one to maximize the summation
concatenated array size 10e5
a[i] < 10e6


you can modify the order of elements in each array




that's not the problem actually



larger values earlier on are better
s, m, l = small, med, large
m + m > l + s




is it not just the reverse order ?
ohh i see


(6, 1), (4, 4)
6 * 4
1 * 3
4 * 2
4 * 1

(4, 4), (6, 1)
4 * 4
4 * 3 
6 * 2
1 * 1



a * b + c * d + e * f 

4 * 6 + 4 * 5 + 4 * 4


4 * 5
4 * 4



question is how to concatenate the subarrays
intuition is by array average
not quite sure how to prove
just more example test cases and see

can just run it and see what happens
